This is a cloud data server for forkphorus.

 - this is not a reimplementation of the Scratch cloud data server
 - this does not implement the same protocol as the Scratch cloud data server
 - this is not a "permanent"/"long term" data server, all "rooms" are short lived and destructible
 - this is not used by or part of Scratch, obviously
